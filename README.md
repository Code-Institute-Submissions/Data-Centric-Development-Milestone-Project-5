# HorseNet

This is a website for stallion owners to follow their offsprings progressions and for the offspring owners to follow their horses siblings 
and also the progression in both breeding and achievements of the stallions.

 
## User Experience (UX)

The owner of an offspring can register an account and login to add the offspring to the database. The same person can also edit and delete
the offspring whenever they want to, and also read about other offsprings (the CRUD functionality). This site is for breeders and I had an 
idea of a family tree when I created this site. Although there is not a family tree there is at least some information on every 
offspring about their mother and father. The stallions have information about how many offsprings each stallion has. There is a search-bar 
for searching the offsprings. You can search on everything, for example search for one of the stallions and view all the offprings he has. 
This type of site could also be useful for breeding catteries and kennels. The idea of following the males (and also the females) 
progression in breeding is interesting to know for both the owner and the owners of the offsprings. And this site acts a bit like a community
for the offspring owners to come together. At the moment offsprings is only added to the "offspring A-I" page, since I have not done the 
functionality for the "offspring J-R" nor the "offspring S-Z". These two last pages is empty for now.


- ### User stories

    - **First Time Visitor Goals**   
        1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site
        2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.

    - **Returning Visitor Goals**   
        1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to search the site
        2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to follow the stallions 

    - **Frequent Visitor Goals**    
        1. As a Frequent Visitor, I want to be able to register an account and login 
        2. As a Frequent Visitor, I want to interact with the site and add content

- ### Design 
    - **Color Scheme**   
    ([see colour affects here](http://www.colour-affects.co.uk/psychological-properties-of-colours))
    The rose-red color scheme is for the love between horses and their owners and for the bloodbands that this site is representing. 

    - **Typography**    
    The Montserrat font is the main font used.

    - **Imagery**   
    
    
    - **Interactivity**   
    Users can register and login to add offsprings. This is reflected on the percent-bar on the homepage where statistics over how many
    offsprings each stallion has i represented.

- ### Wireframe
    The wireframe is included as pdf files in the project itself (in a separate directory called wireframes).

## Features

- ### Existing Features
    - 

- ### Features Left to Implement
    - Offsprings should be listed alpfabetically on pages A-I, J-R and S-Z for easier navigation, even though you can search the offsprings.
    - Admin page perhaps...

## Testing

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section
**First Time Visitor Goals**    
1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site
    i. Upon entering the site, users can easily navigate the site through the navigation bar.
    ii. On the start/home page there is statistics about how many procent of the offsprings each stallion has.


2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.   
    i. At the top of each page there is a navigation bar, each link describes what page they will end up at.
    ii. On both the register and login page, the page refreshes and the user is brought to the top of the homepage 
    where the navigation bar is.
 

**Returning Visitor Goals**   
1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to search the site
    i. There is a search-bar on the offspringAI page. 

**Frequent Visitor Goals**    
1. 

### Further testing
* Most testing was done throughout development, and it was manual tests. 

* Different web-browsers (Opera, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Chrome) and Samsung galaxy 9 - Android have been used to check the website's layout and that 
    the site works well on different devices and screensizes. Where needed I used media query to fix any responsiveness issues.


### Validation 

* The code have been validated in a [HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input), [CSS validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) 
    and [JavaScript validator](https://jshint.com/) respectively.
    
### Known bugs

## Deployment


## Expanding on my project

Is not allowed until I've finished the course at Code Institute. I'll let you know when.
